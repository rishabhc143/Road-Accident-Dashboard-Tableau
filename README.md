# Road-Accident-Dashboard-Tableau
I have created a Tableau Dashboard for analyzing road accident data in the UK. It allows filtering by year and accident severity, enabling year-over-year comparisons. The dashboard also shows casualties by vehicle type and road category, and it analyzes how weather and road conditions affect accident severity.
